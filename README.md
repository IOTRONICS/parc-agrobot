   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parc-agrobot.git
   ```

5. Build and compile any custom ROS packages included in the repository.

## Usage

1. Launch ROS nodes for sensor data collection:

   ```bash
   roslaunch parc_agrobot sensors.launch
   ```

2. Run the Python scripts for data processing and control:

   ```bash
   python data_processing.py
   python control.py
   ```

3. Utilize Matlab scripts for in-depth data analysis and visualization:

   ```matlab
   run analyze_data.m
   ```
